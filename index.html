         Water pollution is a significant environmental concern, with emerging contaminants posing a challenge to traditional water treatment methods. 
         Photocatalytic water treatment has emerged as a promising technology for removing these contaminants. 
         This article provides an overview of photocatalytic water treatment for emerging contaminants, including the principles of photocatalysis, 
         the use of photocatalysts, and recent advancements in the field. The effectiveness of photocatalytic water treatment is demonstrated 
         through the removal of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care products. 
         The potential of photocatalytic water treatment in addressing emerging contaminants is highlighted, with a focus on its application in real-world settings.
