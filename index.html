Rapid industrialization and urbanization have introduced emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, dyes, and industrial effluents, into water systems, posing threats to human health and the environment. 
Conventional wastewater treatments are inadequate for removing these persistent pollutants, necessitating advanced methods. Photocatalysis,
         a promising Advanced Oxidation Process, uses semiconductor photocatalysts activated by light energy to generate reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals, which degrade contaminants into harmless end products like COâ‚‚ and water.
    This review examines the principles, mechanisms, and innovations in photocatalytic water treatment, focusing on emerging contaminants. 
         It evaluates photocatalyst stability, efficiency, and potential solutions, highlighting progress toward complete water decontamination and global water sustainability.

Industrialisation and urbanisation in recent decades have released a variety of emergent contaminants to water bodies. Pollutants made from pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial discharges, and agricultural drainage carry vast risks for human health as well as for the environment. 
         Conventional processes applied for the treatment of wastewater are often inefficient in due to the persistent nature of these contaminants, 
  advanced and sustainable treatment technologies are necessary. Photocatalysis has come out to be a developing technology in advanced oxidation process for the removal of emerging contaminants from water. 
This refers to a process whereby a semiconductor photocatalyst utilizes energy from light to produce highly reactive species for example hydroxyl radicals. These species can fully oxidise organic contaminants to non-hazardous carbon dioxide and water.
