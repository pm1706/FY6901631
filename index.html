Rapid industrialization and urbanization have introduced emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, dyes, and industrial effluents, 
         into water systems, posing threats to human health and the environment. 
Conventional wastewater treatments are inadequate for removing these persistent pollutants, necessitating advanced methods. Photocatalysis,
a promising Advanced Oxidation Process, uses semiconductor photocatalysts activated by light energy to generate reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals,
         which degrade contaminants into harmless end products like CO₂ and water.
This review examines the principles, mechanisms, and innovations in photocatalytic water treatment, focusing on emerging contaminants. 
 It evaluates photocatalyst stability, efficiency, and potential solutions, highlighting progress toward complete water decontamination and global water sustainability.

       <pre>
Industrialisation and urbanisation in recent decades have released a variety of emergent contaminants to water bodies.
         Pollutants made from pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial discharges, and agricultural 
         drainage carry vast risks for human health as well as for the environment. 
Conventional processes applied for the treatment of wastewater are often inefficient in due to the persistent nature of these contaminants, 
advanced and sustainable treatment technologies are necessary. Photocatalysis has come out to be a developing technology in 
         the advanced oxidation process for the removal of emerging contaminants from water. 
This refers to a process whereby a semiconductor photocatalyst utilizes energy from light to produce highly reactive species for example hydroxyl radicals. 
These species can fully oxidise organic contaminants to non-hazardous carbon dioxide and water.

<h3 id=”Low cost adsorbents for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater”>Low cost adsorbents for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater</h3>
Water pollution due to organic contaminants is a serious issue because of acute toxicities and carcinogenic nature of the pollutants.
Among various water treatment methods, adsorption is supposed as the best one due to its inexpensiveness, universal nature and ease of operation. 
Many waste materials used include fruit wastes, coconut shell, scrap tyres, bark and other tannin-rich materials, 
These adsorbents have been found to remove various organic pollutants ranging from 80 to 99.9%.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479712004367">( Ali, I., Asim, M. and Khan, T.A., 2012.)</a>

<h3 id="Decontamination and disinfection of water by solar photocatalysis: recent overview and trends">Decontamination and disinfection of water by solar photocatalysis: recent overview and trends</h3>
Advanced Oxidation Processes  may be used for decontamination of water containing organic pollutants, classified as bio-recalcitrant, and/or for disinfection removing current and emerging pathogens. These methods rely on the formation of highly reactive chemical species which degrade even the most recalcitrant molecules into biodegradable compounds. The photocatalytic process has received growing interest during the last years; this field is now covered by more than 1,000 peer-reviewed articles every year.
Because of the simplicity of the search, not every related article has been retrieved in this work, but it indicates the growing interest within the scientific community.
Figure 1 shows the temporal evolution of the publication activity, highlighting that much attention has been given to the exploitation of solar radiation to drive photocatalytic processes. The reason for this attention lies in the intrinsic aptitude of photocatalysis, compared to other AOPs, for operation under sunlight conditions.
This monograph covers the recent advances made in the science and technology of solar photocatalytic disinfection of water and decontamination. It also deals with the enhancement of water resources by safe reutilization of treated wastewater and improvement in the treatments of industrial effluents.

       <pre>
Photocatalysis is a technique that uses semiconductor materials such as titanium dioxide to absorb light energy and activate the reactions that decompose pollutants. 
  The exposure of the photocatalyst to ultraviolet  or visible light creates an electron-hole pair. The reactive species react with the water molecules and dissolved oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals.
  These Reactive oxygen species are very reactive and can non-selectively oxidise a large number of emerging contaminents into less harmful or completely mineralised compounds.

       <pre>
Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation has been under great investigation because of its efficiency and sustainability in treating wastewater. 
  It uses a solid photocatalyst-usually semiconductor-to convert light energy for the oxidation degradation of organic and inorganic contaminants in water. 
  In this process, it degrades dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial effluents and, therefore, is versatile in the approach toward wastewater remediation. Water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen through this process in 1972. 
   Hence early studies were focused on the production of hydrogen using solar energy as a clean fuel from water (Kaan, C.C., Aziz, A.A., Ibrahim, S., Matheswaran, M. and Saravanan, P., 2012.)

      Photocatalytic water treatment has undergone significant evolution in recent years, answering the demands for more sustainable and effective solutions to current water pollution. Chlorination has been one of the most popular water treatment methods for disinfection, but recently, the combination with photocatalytic technology has gained much attention due to its potential to enhance the efficiency of water purification. 
         While chlorination alone is quite effective against pathogens, it forms harmful  disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids  Photocatalysis combined with chlorination addresses these issues by enhancing disinfection, degrading organic precursors of DBPs, and simultaneously treating a diverse array of contaminants.
 Chlorination has been the most commonly and widely used disinfection process. The disinfection by-products generated from chlorination are mutagenic and carcinogenic to human health (Yang and Cheng, 2007, Lu et al., 2009, Coleman et al., 2005). These have lead to the rapid R&D in the field of “Advanced Oxidation Processes ” as the innovative water treatment technologies
