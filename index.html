         Water pollution is a significant environmental concern, with emerging contaminants posing a challenge to traditional water treatment methods. 
         Photocatalytic water treatment has emerged as a promising technology for removing these contaminants. 
         This article provides an overview of photocatalytic water treatment for emerging contaminants, including the principles of photocatalysis, 
         the use of photocatalysts, and recent advancements in the field. The effectiveness of photocatalytic water treatment is demonstrated 
         through the removal of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care products. 
         The potential of photocatalytic water treatment in addressing emerging contaminants is highlighted, with a focus on its application in real-world settings.

Water Pollution is a global growing problem emerging, with respect to recent attention, because emerging contaminants, unlike conventional substances, are retained in treated effluents with a consequent challenge to the water treatment world. The substances not classified under conventional pollutants should be defined as those formulated as a contaminant according to established laws, orders, and decrees formulated mainly since the 1990s. They contaminate surface and groundwater and end up in drinking water and substantially pose unknown consequences to humans and ecology. Traditional water treatment processes may not deliver adequate efficiency for the removal of some drugs, pesticides, and household products in water. This becomes unrealistic in need of a set of novel technologies for water treatment.
One such technology can be photocatalytic water treatment using photocatalysts to cause degradation in contaminants in water. Photocatalysis may refer to the process whereby light energy is used to excite a semiconductive catalyst like titanium dioxide (TiO2) to generate oxidants and reductants that can decompose organic substances. Much focus of interest has gone into proposing other sources of such catalysts. The process is already well understood, and as such, photocatalysis promises an efficient treatment process should for the removal of emerging wastes from wastewater.
